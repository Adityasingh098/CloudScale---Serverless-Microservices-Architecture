# 🌐 CloudScale – Serverless Microservices Architecture

**CloudScale** is a cloud-native application built on AWS serverless technologies. Designed for high scalability and fault tolerance, it processes high-volume data streams while ensuring efficient resource usage and minimal operational overhead. Ideal for handling large-scale applications with ease.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- **AWS Lambda** - Serverless compute to handle requests and background processes
- **API Gateway** - Manages APIs and integrates with Lambda
- **DynamoDB** - NoSQL database for fast, scalable data storage
- **S3** - Object storage for scalable and secure file management
- **CloudFormation** - Infrastructure as code for provisioning and managing AWS resources

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ Auto-scaling serverless architecture with AWS Lambda
- 🧩 Microservices-driven application for modularity
- 📦 File storage in AWS S3
- 🏙️ High availability and fault tolerance built-in
- 💾 Scalable, low-latency data storage using DynamoDB
- 📜 Infrastructure as code using AWS CloudFormation
